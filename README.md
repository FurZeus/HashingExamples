# 🔢 Hashing Visualization (Interactive & Animated)

This project provides a clean, interactive and fully animated visualization of the most common hashing techniques:

- **Linear Probing**
- **Quadratic Probing**
- **Double Hashing**
- **Separate Chaining**

Each method is displayed step-by-step with table animations, collision handling, and clear visual feedback.  
Great for learning, teaching, or demonstrating how hash tables work internally.
